BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE 
LEO TOLSTOY, 18281910 



COUNT LEO NIKOLAYEVICH TOLSTOY was born 
August 28, 1828, at the family estate of Yasna- 
ya Polyana, in the province of Tula. His moth- 
er died when he was three and his father six 
years later. Placed in the care of his aunts, he 
passed many of his early years at Kazan, where, 
in 1844, after a preliminary training by French 
tutors, he entered the university. He cared lit- 
tle for the university and in 1847 withdrew be- 
cause of "ill-health and domestic circum- 
stances." He had, however, done a great deal 
of reading, of French, English, and Russian 
novels, the New Testament, Voltaire, and 
Hegel. The author exercising the greatest in- 
fluence upon him at this time was Rousseau; 
he read his complete works and for sometime 
wore about his neck a medallion of Rousseau. 

Immediately upon leaving the university, 
Tolstoy returned to his estate and, perhaps inr 
spired by his enthusiasm for Rousseau, pre- 
pared to devote himself to agriculture and to 
improving the condition of his serfs. His first 
attempt at social reform proved disappointing, 
and after six months he withdrew to Moscow 
and St. Petersburg, where he gave himself over 
to the irregular life characteristic of his class 
and time. In 1851, determined to "escape my 
debts and, more than anything else, my hab- 
its," he enlisted in the Army as a gentleman- 
volunteer, and went to the Caucasus. While at 
Tiflis, preparing for his examinations as a 
cadet, he wrote the first portion of the trilogy, 
Childhood, Boyhood, and Youth, in which he 
celebrated the happiness of "being with Na- 
ture, seeing her, communing with her." He al- 
so began The Cossacks with the intention of 
showing that culture is the enemy of happi- 
ness. Although continuing his army life, he 
gradually came to realize that "a military ca- 
reer is not for me, and the sooner I get out of 
it and devote myself entirely to literature the 
better." His Sevastopol Sketches (1855) were 
so successful that Czar Nicholas issued special 
orders that he should be removed from a post 
of danger. 

Returning to St. Petersburg, Tolstoy was re- 
ceived with great favor in both the official and 
literary circles of the capital. He soon became 



interested in the popular progressive move- 
ment of the time, and in 1857 he decided to go 
abroad and study the educational and munici- 
pal systems of other countries. That year, and 
again in 1860, he traveled in Europe. At Yas- 
naya Polyana in 1861 he liberated his serfs and 
opened a school, established on the principle 
that "everything which savours of compulsion 
is harmful." He started a magazine to promote 
his notions on education and at the same time 
served as an official arbitrator for grievances 
between the nobles and the recently emanci- 
pated serfs. By the end of 1863 he was so ex- 
hausted that he discontinued his activities and 
retired to the steppes to drink koumis for his 
health. 

Tolstoy had been contemplating marriage 
for some time, and in 1862 he married Sophie 
Behrs, sixteen years his junior, and the daugh- 
ter of a fashionable Moscow doctor. Their 
early married life at Yasnaya Polyana was 
tranquil. Family cares occupied the Countess, 
and in the course of her life she bore thirteen 
children, nine of whom survived infancy. Yet 
she also acted as a copyist for her husband, 
who after their marriage turned again to writ- 
ing. He was soon at work upon "a novel of 
the i8io's and *2o's" which absorbed all his 
time and effort. He went frequently to Mos- 
cow, "studying letters, diaries, and traditions" 
and "accumulated a whole library" of histori- 
cal material on the period. He interviewed 
survivors of the battles of that time and trav- 
eled to Borodino to draw up a map of the 
battleground. Finally, in 1869, after his work 
had undergone several changes in conception 
and he had "spent five years of uninterrupted 
andjgxceptionally strenuous labor Tnnierthe 
IbesfcondUtions of life/' he published War and 
Peace. Its appearance immediately established 
Tolstoy's reputation, and in the judgment of 
Turgenev, the acknowledged dean of Russian 
letters, gave him "first place among all our 
contemporary writers." 

The years immediately following the com- 
pletion of War and Peace were pa**efl in a 
great variety of occupations, none of which 
Tohtoy found satisfying. He tried busying

himself with the affairs of his estate, under- 
took the learning of Greek to read the ancient 
classics, turned again to education, wrote a 
series of elementary school books, and served 
as school inspector. With much urging from 
his wife and friends, he completed Anna Kare- 
nina, which appeared serially between 1875 
and 1877. Disturbed by what he considered his 
unreflective and prosperous existence, Tolstoy 
became increasingly interested in religion. At 
first he turned to the orthodox faith of the 
people. Unable to find rest there, he began a 
detailed examination of religions, and out of 
his reading, particularly of the Gospels, gradu- 
ally evolved his own personal doctrine. 

Following his conversion, Tolstoy adopted 
a new mode of life. He dressed like a peasant, 
devoted much of his time to manual work, 
learned shoemaking, and followed a vegetari- 
an diet. With the exception of his youngest 
daughter, Alexandra, Tolstoy's family re- 
mained hostile to his teaching. The breach be- 
tween him and his wife grew steadily wider. 
In 1879 he wrote the Kreutzer Sonata in which 
he attacked the normal state of marriage and 
extolled a life of celibacy and chastity. In 1881 
he divided his estate among his heirs and, a 
few years later, despite the opposition of his 
wife, announced that he would forego royal- 
ties on all the works published after his con- 
version. 

Tolstoy made no attempt at first to propa- 
gate his religious teaching, although it attracted 



many followers. After a visit to the Moscow 
slums iri 1881, he became concerned with social 
conditions, and he subsequently aided the suf- 
ferers of the famine by sponsoring two hun- 
dred and fifty relief kitchens. After his meet- 
ing and intimacy with Chertkov, "Tolstoyism" 
began to develop as an organized sect. Tol- 
stoy's writings became almost exclusively pre- 
occupied with religious problems. In addition 
to numerous pamphlets and plays, he wrote 
IV hat is Art? (1896), in which he explained 
his new aesthetic theories, and Hadji-Murad, 
(1904), which became the favorite work of his 
old age. Although his activities were looked 
upon with increasing suspicion by the official 
authorities, Tolstoy escaped official censure 
until 1901, when he was excommunicated by 
the Orthodox Church. His followers were f re- 
quently subjected to persecution, and many 
were either banished or imprisoned. 

Tolstoy's last years were embittered by 
mounting hostility within his own household. 
Although his personal life was ascetic, he felt 
the ambiguity of his position as a preacher of 
poverty living on his great estate. Finally, at 
the age of eighty-two, with the aid of his daugh- 
ter, Alexandra, he fled from home. His health 
broke down a few days later, and he was re- 
moved from the train to the station-master's 
hut at Astopovo, where he died, November 7, 
1910. He was buried at Yasnaya Polyana, in 
the first public funeral to be held in Russia 
without religious rites.

Book One: 1805 



CHAPTER I 

WELL, PRINCE, so Genoa and Lucca are now 
just family estates of the Buonapartes. But I 
warn you, if you don't tell me that this means 
war, if you still try to defend the infamies and 
horrors perpetrated by that Antichrist I real- 
ly believe he is Antichrist I will have nothing 
more to do with you and you are no longer my 
friend, no longer my 'faithful slave,' as you 
call yourself! But how do you do? I see I have 
frightened you sit down and tell me all the 
news." 

It was in July, 1805, and the speaker was the 
well-known Anna Pdvlovna Sch^rer, maid of 
honor and favorite of the Empress Marya Fe- 
dorovna. With these words she greeted Prince 
Vasili Kurdgin, a man of high rank and impor- 
tance, who was the first to arrive at her recep- 
tion. Anna Pdvlovna had had a cough for some 
days. She was, as she said, suffering from la 
grippe; grippe being then a new word in St. 
Petersburg, used only by the elite. 

All her invitations without exception, writ- 
ten in French, and delivered by a scarlet-liver- 
ied footman that morning, ran as follows: 

"If you have nothing better to do, Count [or 
Prince], and if the prospect of spending an 
evening with a poor invalid is not too terrible, 
I shall be very charmed to see you tonight be- 
tween 7 and 10 Annette Sch^rer." 

"Heavens! what a virulent attack!" replied 
the prince, not in the least disconcerted by this 
reception. He had just entered, wearing an em- 
broidered court uniform, knee breeches, and 
shoes, and had stars on his breast and a serene 
expression on his flat face. He spoke in that 
refined French in which our grandfathers not 
only spoke but thought, and with the gentle, 
patronizing intonation natural to a man of 
importance who had grown old in society and 
at court. He went up to Anna Pavlovna, kissed 
her hand, presenting to her his bald, scented, 
and shining head, and complacently seated 
himself on the sofa. 

"First of all, dear friend, tell me how you 



are. Set your friend's mind at rest," said he 
without altering his tone, beneath the polite- 
ness and affected sympathy of which indiffer- 
ence and even irony could be discerned. 

"Can one be well while suffering morally? 
Can one be calm in tirrfes like these if one has 
any feeling?" said Anna Pdvlovna. "You are 
staying the whole evening, I hope?" 

"And the fete at the English ambassador's? 
Today is Wednesday. I must put in an appear- 
ance there," said the prince. "My daughter is 
coming for me to take me there." 

"I thought today's fete had been canceled. 
I confess all these festivities and fireworks are 
becoming wearisome." 

"If they had known that you wished it, the 
entertainment would have been put off," said 
the prince, who, like a wound-up clock, by 
force of habit said things he did not even wish 
to be believed. 

"Don't tease! Well, and what has been de- 
cided about Novosiltsev's dispatch? You know 
everything." 

"What can one say about it?" replied the 
prince in a cold, listless tone. "What has been 
decided? They have decided that Buonaparte 
has burnt his boats, and I believe that we are 
ready to burn ours." 

Prince Vastti always spoke languidly, like 
an actor repeating a stale part. Anna Pdvlovna 
Scherer on the contrary, despite her forty years, 
overflowed with animation and impulsiveness. 
To be an enthusiast had become her social vo- 
cation and, sometimes even when she did not 
feel like it, she became enthusiastic in order 
not to disappoint the expectations of those 
who knew her. The subdued smile which, 
though it did not suit her faded features, al- 
ways played round her lips expressed, as in a 
spoiled child, a continual consciousness of her 
charming defect, which she neither wished, nor 
could, nor considered it necessary, to correct. 

In the midst of a conversation on political 
matters Anna Pdvlovna burst out: 

"Oh, don't speak to me of Austria. Perhaps 



WAR AND PEACE 



I don't understand things, but Austria never 
has wished, and does not wish, for war. She is 
betraying us! Russia alone must save Europe. 
Our gracious sovereign recognizes his high vo- 
cation and will be true to it. That is the one 
thing I have faith in! Our good and wonder- 
ful sovereign has to perfonn the noblest role 
on earth, and he is so virtuous and noble that 
God will not forsake him. He will fulfill his 
vocation and crush the hydra of revolution, 
which has become more terrible than ever in 
the person of this murderer and villain! We 
alone must avenge the blood of the just one. 
. . . Whom, I ask you, can we rely on? . . . Eng- 
land with her commercial spirit will not and 
cannot understand the Emperor Alexander's 
loftiness of soul. She tias refused to evacuate 
Malta. She wanted to find, and still seeks, some 
secret motive in our actions. What answer did 
Novosiltsev get? None. The English have not 
understood and cannot understand the self- 
abnegation of our Emperor who wants noth- 
ing for himself, but only desires the good of 
mankind. And what have they promised? Noth- 
ing! And what little they have promised they 
will not perform! Prussia has always declared 
that Buonaparte is invincible and that all 
Europe is powerless before him. . . . And I 
don't believe a word that Hardenburg says, 
or Haugwitz either. This famous Prussian neu- 
trality is just a trap. I have faith only in God 
and the lofty destiny of our adored monarch. 
He will save Europe!" 

She suddenly paused, smiling at her own 
impetuosity. 

"I think," said the prince with a smile, "that 
if you had been sent instead of our dear 
Wintzingerode you would have captured the 
King of Prussia's consent by assault. You are 
so eloquent. Will you give me a cup of tea?" 

"In a moment. X propos"she added, becom- 
ing calm again, "I am expecting two very in- 
teresting men tonight, le Vicomte de Morte- 
mart, who is connected with the Montmoren- 
cys through the Rohans,oneof the best French 
families. He is one of the genuine dmigrh, the 
good ones. And also the Abbe* Morio. Do you 
know that profound thinker? He has been re- 
ceived by the Emperor. Had you heard?" 

"I shall be delighted to meet them," said the 
prince. "But tell me," he added with studied 
carelessness as if it had only just occurred to 
him, though the question he was about to ask 
was the chief motive of his visit, "is it true that 
the Dowager Empress wants Baron Funke to be 
appointed first secretary at Vienna? The baron 



by all accounts is a poor creature." 

Prince Vasfli wished to obtain this post for 
his son, but others were trying through the 
Dowager Empress Mdrya Fedorovna to secure 
it for the baron. 

Anna Pdvlovna almost closed her eyes to in- 
dicate that neither she nor anyone else had a 
right to criticize what the Empress desired or 
was pleased with. 

"Baron Funke has been recommended to the 
Dowager Empress by her sister," was all she 
said, in a dry and mournful tone. 

As she named the Empress, Anna Pdvlovna's 
face suddenly assumed an expression of pro- 
found and sincere devotion and respect min- 
gled with sadness, and thisoccurred every time 
she mentioned her illustrious patroness. She 
added that Her Majesty had deigned to show 
Baron Funke beaucoup d'estime, and again 
her face clouded over with sadness. 

The prince was silent and looked indiffer- 
ent. But, with the womanly and courtierlike 
quickness and tact habitual to her, Anna Pdv- 
lovna wished both to rebuke him (for daring 
to speak as he had done of a man recommended 
to the Empress) and at the same time to con- 
sole him, so she said: 

"Now about your family. Do you know that 
since your daughter came out everyone has 
been enraptured by her? They say she is amaz- 
ingly beautiful." 

The prince bowed to signify his respect and 
gratitude. 

"I often think," she continued after a short 
pause, drawing nearer to the prince and smil- 
ing amiably at him as if to show that political 
and social topics were ended and the time had 
come for intimate conversation "I often think 
how unfairly sometimes the joys of life are dis- 
tributed. Why has fate given you two such 
splendid children? I don't speak of Anatole, 
your youngest. I don't like him," she added in 
a tone admitting of no rejoinder and raising 
her eyebrows. "Two such charming children. 
And really you appreciate them less than any- 
one, and so you don't deserve to have them." 

And she smiled her ecstatic smile. 

"I can't help it," said the prince. "Lavater 
would have said I lack the bump of paternity." 

"Don't joke; I mean to have a serious talk 
with you. Do you know I am dissatisfied with 
your younger son? Between ourselves" (and 
her face assumed its melancholy expression), 
"he was mentioned at Her Majesty's and you 
were pitied. . . ." 

The prince answered nothing, but she 



BOOK ONE 



looked at him significantly, awaiting a reply. 
He frowned. 

"What would you have me do?" he said at 
last. "You know I did all a father could for 
their education, and they have both turned 
out fools. Hippolyte is at least a quiet fool, but 
Anatole is an active one. That is the only dif- 
ference between them." He said this smiling 
in a way more natural and animated than 
usual, so that the wrinkles round his mouth 
very clearly revealed something unexpectedly 
coarse and unpleasant. 

"And why are children born to such men as 
you? If you were not a father there would be 
nothing I could reproach you with," said Anna 
Pdvlovna, looking up pensively. 

"I am your faithful slave and to you alone I 
can confess that my children are the bane of 
my life. It is the cross I have to bear. That is 
how I explain it to myself. It can't be helped!" 

He said no more, but expressed his resigna- 
tion to cruel fate by a gesture. Anna Pdvlovna 
meditated. 

"Have you never thought of marrying your 
prodigal son Anatole?" she asked. "They say 
old maids have a mania for matchmaking, and 
though I don't feel that weakness in myself as 
yet, I know a little person who is very unhappy 
with her father. She is a relation of yours, 
Princess Mary Bolk6nskaya." 

Prince Vasili did not reply, though, with the 
quickness of memory and perception befitting 
a man of the world, he indicated by a move- 
ment of the head that he was considering this 
information. 

"Do you know," he said at last, evidently 
unable to check the sad current of his thoughts, 
"that Anatole is costing me forty thousand 
rubles a year? And," he went on after a pause, 
"what will it be in five years, if he goes on like 
this?" Presently he added: "That's what we 

fathers have to put up with Is this princess 

of yours rich?" 

"Her father is very rich and stingy. He lives 
in the country. He is the well-known Prince 
Bolk6nski who had to retire from the army un- 
der the late Emperor, and was nicknamed 'the 
King of Prussia.' He is very clever but eccen- 
tric, and a bore. The poor girl is very unhappy. 
She has a brother; I think you know him, he 
married Lise Meinen lately. He is an aide-de- 
camp of Kutiizov's and will be here tonight." 

"Listen, dear Annette," said the prince, sud- 
denly taking Anna Pdvlovna's hand and for 
some reason drawing it downwards. "Arrange 
that affair for me and I shall always be your 



most devoted slave slaje with an /, as a village 
elder of mine writes in his reports. She is rich 
and of good family and that's all I want." 

And with the familiarity and easy grace 
peculiar to him, he raised the maid of honor's 
hand to his lips, kissed it, and swung it to and 
fro as he lay back in his armchair, looking in 
another direction. 

"Attendee" said Anna Pdvlovna, reflecting, 
"I'll speak to Lise, young Bolk6nski's wife, this 
very evening, and perhaps the thing can be 
arranged. It shall be on your family's behalf 
that I'll start my apprenticeship as old maid." 

CHAPTER II 

ANNA PAVLOVNA'S drawing room was gradually 
filling. The highest Petersburg society was as- 
sembled there: people differing widely in age 
and character but alike in the social circle to 
which they belonged. Prince Vasili's daughter, 
the beautiful Hlne, came to take her father 
to the ambassador's entertainment; she wore a 
ball dress and her badge as maid of honor. The 
youthful little Princess Bolkonskaya, known 
as la femme la plus sSduisante de Pfaersbourg? 
was also there. She had been married during 
the previous winter, and being pregnant did 
not go to any large gatherings, but only to small 
receptions. Prince Vasfli's son, Hippolyte, had 
come with Mortemart, whom he introduced. 
The Abb6 Morio and many others had also 
come. 

To each new arrival Anna Pdvlovna safcl, 
"You have not yet seen my aunt," or "You do 
not know my aunt?" and very gravely con- 
ducted him or her to a little old lady, wearing 
large bows of ribbon in her cap, who had come 
sailing in from another room as soon as the 
guests began to arrive; and slowly turning her 
eyes from the visitor to her aunt, Anna Pdv- 
lovna mentioned each one's name and then 
left them. 

Each visitor performed the ceremony of 
greeting this old aunt whom not one of them 
knew, not one of them wanted to know, and 
not one of them cared about; Anna Pdvlovna 
observed these greetings with mournful and sol- 
emn interest and silent approval. The aunt 
spoke to each of them in the same words, about 
their health and her own, and the health of 
Her Majesty, "who, thank God, was better to- 
day." And each visitor, though politeness pre- 
vented his showing impatience, left the old 
woman with a sense of relief at having per- 
formed a vexatious duty and did not return to 

1 The most fascinating woman in Petersburg.

her the whole evening. 

The young Princess Bolk6nskaya had 
brought some work in a gold-embroidered vel- 
vet bag. Her pretty little upper lip, on which 
a delicate dark down was just perceptible, was 
too short for her teeth, but it lifted all the more 
sweetly, and was especially charming when she 
occasionally drew it down to meet the lower 
lip. As is always the case with a thoroughly at- 
tractive woman, her defectthe shortness of 
her upperlip and her half-open mouth seemed 
to be her own special and peculiar form of 
beauty. Everyone brightened at the sight of 
this pretty young woman, so soon to become 
a mother, so full of life and health, and carry- 
ing her burden so lightly. Old men and dull 
dispirited young ones who looked at her, after 
being in her company and talking to her a 
litttle while, felt as if they too were becoming, 
like her, full of life and health. All who talked 
to her, and at each word saw her bright smile 
and the constant gleam of her white teeth, 
thought that they were in a specially amiable 
mood that day. 

The little princess went round the table 
with quick, short, swaying steps, her workbag 
on her arm, and gaily spreading out her dress 
sat down on a sofa near the silver samovar, as 
if all she was doing was a pleasure to herself 
and to all around her. "I have brought my 
work," said she in French, displaying her bag 
and addressing all present. "Mind, Annette, 
I hope you have not played a wicked trick on 
me," she added, turning to her hostess. "You 
wrote that it was to be quite a small reception, 
and just see how badly I am dressed." And she 
spread out her arms to show her short-waisted, 
lace-trimmed, dainty gray dress, girdled with 
a broad ribbon just below the breast. 

"Soyez tranquille, Lise, you will always be 
prettier than anyone else," replied Anna Pdv- 
lovna. 

"You know/' said the princess in the same 
tone of voice and still in French, turning to a 
general, "my husband is deserting me? He is 
going to get himself killed. Tell me what this 
wretched war is for?" she added, addressing 
Prince Vasfli, and without waiting for an an- 
swer she turned to speak to his daughter, the 
beautiful Hlne. 

"What a delightful woman this little prin- 
cess isl" said Prince Vasili to Anna Pdvlovna. 

One of the next arrivals was a stout, heavily 
built young man with close-cropped hair, spec- 
tacles, the light-colored breeches fashionable 
at that time, a very high ruffle, and a brown 



dress coat. This stout young man was an illegit- 
imate son^of Count Bezukhov, a well-known 
grandee of Catherine's time who now lay dy- 
ing in Moscow. The young man had not yet 
entered either the military or civil service, as 
he had only just returned from abroad where 
he had been educated, and this was his first ap- 
pearance in society. Anna Pdvlovna greeted 
him with the nod she accorded to the lowest 
hierarchy in her drawing room. But in spite of 
this lowest-grade greeting, a look of anxiety 
and fear, as at the sight of something too large 
and unsuited to the place, came over her face 
when she saw Pierre enter. Though he was cer- 
tainly rather bigger than the other men in the 
room, her anxiety could only have reference 
to the clever though shy, but observant and 
natural, expression which distinguished him 
from everyone else in that drawing room. 

"It is very good of you, Monsieur Pierre, to 
come and visit a poor invalid," said Anna Pdv- 
lovna, exchanging an alarmed glance with her 
aunt as she conducted him to her. 

Pierre murmured something unintelligible, 
and continued to look round as if in search of 
something. On his way to the aunt he bowed 
to the little princess with a pleased smile, as to 
an intimate acquaintance. 

Anna Pdvlovna's alarm was justified, for 
Pierre turned away from the aunt without wait- 
ing to hear her speech about Her Majesty's 
health. Anna Pdvlovna in dismay detained 
him with the words: "Do you know the Abbe* 
Morio? He is a most interesting man." 

"Yes, I have heard of his scheme for perpet- 
ual peace, and it is very interesting but hardly 
feasible." 

"You think so?" rejoined Anna Pdvlovna in 
order to say something and get away to attend 
to her duties as hostess. But Pierre now com- 
mitted a reverse act of impoliteness. First he 
had left a lady before she had finished speak- 
ing to him, and now he continued to speak to 
another who wished to getaway. With his head 
bent, and his big feet spread apart, he began 
explaining his reasons for thinking the abbess 
plan chimerical. 

"We will talk of it later," said Anna Pdv- 
lovna with a smile. 

And having got rid of this young man who 
did not know how to behave, she resumed her 
duties as hostess and continued to listen and 
watch, ready to help at any point where the 
conversation might happen to flag. As the fore- 
man of a spinning mill, when he has set the 
hands to work, goes round and notices here a 



BOOK ONE 



spindle that has stopped or there one that 
creaks or makes more noise than it should, and 
hastens to check the machine or set it in proper 
motion, so Anna Pavlovna moved about her 
drawing room, approaching now a silent, now 
a too-noisy group, and by a word or slight re- 
arrangement kept the conversational machine 
in steady, proper, and regular motion. But 
amid these cares her anxiety about Pierre was 
evident. She kept an anxious watch on him 
when he approached the group round Morte- 
mart to listen to what was being said there, and 
again when he passed to another group whose 
center was the abbe*. 

Pierre had been educated abroad, and this 
reception at Anna Pavlovna's was the first he 
had attended in Russia. He knew that all the 
intellectual lights of Petersburg were gathered 
there and, like a child in a toyshop, did not 
know which way to look, afraid of missing any 
clever conversation that was to be heard. See- 
ing the self-confident and refined expression 
on the faces of those present he was always ex- 
pecting to hear something very profound. At 
last he came up to Morio. Here the conversa- 
tion seemed interesting and he stood waiting 
for an opportunity to express his own views, 
as young people are fond of doing. 

CHAPTER III 

ANNA PAVLOVNA'S reception was in full swing. 
The spindles hummed steadily and ceaselessly 
on all sides. With the exception of the aunt, 
beside whom sat only one elderly lady, who 
with her thin careworn face was rather out of 
place in this brilliant society, the whole com- 
pany had settled into three groups. One, chiefly 
masculine, had formed round the abbe". An- 
other, of young people, was grouped round 
the beautiful Princess Hlne, Prince Vasfli's 
daughter, and the little Princess Bolk6nskaya, 
very pretty and rosy, though rather too plump 
for her age. The third group was gathered 
round Mortemart and Anna Pavlovna. 

The vicomte was a nice-looking young man 
with soft features and polished manners, who 
evidently considered himself a celebrity but 
out of politeness modestly placed himself at 
the disposal of the circle in which he found 
himself. Anna Pdvlovna was obviously serving 
him up as a treat to her guests. As a clever 
maitre d'hotel serves up as a specially choice 
delicacy a piece of meat that no one who had 
seen it in the kitchen would have cared to eat, 
so Anna Pavlovna served up to her guests, first 
the vicomte and then the abbe*, as peculiarly 



choice morsels. The group about Mortemart 
immediately began discussing the murder of the 
Due d'Enghien. The vicomte said that the Due 
d'Enghien had perished by his own magna- 
nimity, and that there were particular reasons 
for Buonaparte's hatred of him. 

"Ah, yes! Do tell us all about it, Vicomte," 
said Anna Pdvlovna, with a pleasant feeling 
that there was something a la Louis XV in the 
sound of that sentence: "Contez nous gela, 
Vicomte." 

The vicomte bowed and smiled courteously 
in token of his willingness to comply. Anna 
Pavlovna arranged a group round him, invit- 
ing everyone to listen to his tale. 

"The vicomte knew the due personally," 
whispered Anna Pdvlovna to one of the guests. 
"The vicomte is a wonderful raconteur," said 
she to another. "How evidently he belongs to 
the best society," said she to a third; and the 
vicomte was served up to the company in the 
choicest and most advantageous style, like a 
well-garnished joint of roast beef on a hot 
dish. 

The vicomte wished to begin his story and 
gave a subtle smile. 

"Come over here, Hlne, dear," said Anna 
Pvlovna to the beautiful young princess who 
was sitting some way off, the center of another 
group. 

The princess smiled. She rose with the same 
unchanging smile with which she had first en- 
tered the room the smile of a perfectly beauti- 
ful woman. With a slight rustle of her white 
dress trimmed with moss and ivy, with a gleam 
of white shoulders, glossy hair, and sparkling 
diamonds, she passed between the men who 
made way for her, not looking at any of them 
but smiling on all, as if graciously allowing 
each the privilege of admiring her beautiful 
figure and shapely shoulders, back, and bosom 
which in the fashion of those days were very 
much exposed and she seemed to bring the 
glamour of a ballroom with her as she moved 
toward Anna Pavlovna. Hlene was so lovely 
that not only did she not show any trace of 
coquetry, but on the contrary she even appeared 
shy of her unquestionable and all too victori- 
ous beauty. She seemed to wish, but to be un- 
able, to diminish its effect. 

"How lovely!" said everyone who saw her; 
and the vicomte lifted his shoulders and 
dropped his eyes as if startled by something ex- 
traordinary when she took her seat opposite and 
beamed upon him also with her unchanging 
smile.

WAR AND PEACE 



"Madame, I doubt my ability before such 
an audience," said he, smilingly inclining his 
head. 

The princess rested her bare round arm on 
a little table and considered a reply unneces- 
sary. She smilingly waited. All the time the 
story was being told she sat upright, glancing 
now at her beautiful round arm, altered in 
shape by its pressure on the table, now at her 
still more beautiful bosom, on which she read- 
justed a diamond necklace. From time to time 
she smoothed the folds of her dress, and when- 
ever the story produced an effect she glanced 
at Anna Pavlovna, at once adopted just the 
expression she saw on the maid of honor's face, 
and again relapsed into her radiant smile. 

The little princess had also left the tea table 
and followed Helne. 

"Wait a moment, I'll get my work. . . . Now 
then, what are you thinking of?" she went on, 
turning to Prince Hippolyte. "Fetch me my 
workbag." 

There was a general movement as the prin- 
cess, smiling and talking merrily to everyone 
at once, sat down and gaily arranged herself in 
her seat. 

"Now I am all right," she said, and asking 
the vicomte to begin, she took up her work. 

Prince Hippolyte, having brought the work- 
bag, joined the circle and moving a chair close 
to hers seated himself beside her. 

Le charmant Hippolyte was surprising by 
his extraordinary resemblance to his beautiful 
sister, but yet more by the fact that in spite of 
this resemblance he was exceedingly ugly. His 
features were like his sister's, but while in her 
case everything was lit up by a joyous, self- 
satisfied, youthful, and constant smile of ani- 
mation, and by the wonderful classic beauty 
of her figure, his face on the contrary was 
dulled by imbecility and a constant expression 
of sullen self-confidence, while his body was 
thin and weak. His eyes, nose, and mouth all 
seemed puckered into a vacant, wearied gri- 
mace, and his arms and legs always fell into 
unnatural positions. 

"It's not going to be a ghost story?" said he, 
sitting down beside the princess and hastily 
adjusting his lorgnette, as if without this in- 
strument he could not begin to speak. 

"Why no, my dear fellow," said the aston- 
ished narrator, shrugging his shoulders. 

"Because I hate ghost stones," said Prince 
Hippolyte in a tone which showed that he only 
understood die meaning of his words after he 
had uttered them. 



He spoke with such self-confidence that his 
hearers ould not be sure whether what he said 
was very witty or very stupid. He was dressed 
in a dark-green dress coat, knee breeches of 
the color of cuisse de nymphe effrayJe, as he 
called it, shoes, and silk stockings. 

The vicomte told his tale very neatly. It was 
an anecdote, then current, to the effect that 
the Due d'Enghien had gone secretly to Paris 
to visit Mademoiselle George; thatat her house 
he came upon Bonaparte, who also enjoyed 
the famous actress' favors, and that in his pres- 
ence Napoleon happened to fall into one of 
the fainting fits to which he was subject, and 
was thus at the due's mercy. The latter spared 
him, and this magnanimity Bonaparte subse- 
quently repaid by death. 

The story was very pretty and interesting, 
especially at the point where the rivals sud- 
denly recognized one another; and the ladies 
looked agitated. 

"Charming!" said Anna PAvlovna with an in- 
quiring glance at the little princess. 

"Charming!" whispered the little princess, 
sticking the needle into her work as if to testify 
that the interest and fascination of the story 
prevented her from going on with it. 

The vicomte appreciated this silent praise 
and smiling gratefully prepared to continue, 
but just then Anna Pavlovna, who had kept a 
watchful eye on the young man who so alarmed 
her, noticed that he was talking too loudly 
and vehemently with the abbe", so she hurried 
to the rescue. Pierre had managed to start a 
conversation with the abb about the balance 
of power, and the latter, evidently interested 
by the young man's simple-minded eagerness, 
was explaining his pet theory. Both were talk- 
ing and listening too eagerly and too naturally, 
which was why Anna Pavlovna disapproved. 

"The means are . . . the balance of power in 
Europe and the rights of the people," the abbe* 
was saying. "It is only necessary for one power- 
ful nation like Russia barbaric as she is said 
to be to place herself disinterestedly at the 
head of an alliance having for its object the 
mai n tenance of the balance of power of Europe, 
and it would save the world!" 

"But how are you to get that balance?" Pierre 
was beginning. 

At that moment Anna Pdvlovna came up and, 
looking severely at Pierre, asked the Italian 
how he stood the Russian climate. The Italian's 
face instantly changed and assumed an offen- 
sively affected, sugary expression, evidently 
habitual to him when conversing with women. 



BOOK 

"I am so enchanted by the brilliancy of the 
wit and culture of the society, more especially 
of the feminine society, in which I have had 
the honor of being received, that I have not 
yet had time to think of the climate," said he. 

Not letting the abbe" and Pierre escape, Anna 
Pdvlovna, the more conveniently to keep them 
under observation, brought them into the 
larger circle. 

CHAPTER IV 

JUST THEN another visitor entered the drawing 
room: Prince Andrew Bolk6nski, the little 
princess' husband. He was a very handsome 
young man, of medium height, with firm, clear- 
cut features. Everything about him, from his 
weary, bored expression to his quiet, measured 
step, offered a most striking contrast to his 
lively little wife. It was evident that he not 
only knew everyone in the drawing room, but 
had found them to be so tiresome that it 
wearied him to look at or listen to them. And 
among all these faces that he found so tedious, 
none seemed to bore him so much as that of 
his pretty wife. He turned away from her with 
a grimace that distorted his handsome face, 
kissed Anna Pdvlovna's hand, and screwing 
up his eyes scanned the whole company. 

"You are off to the war, Prince?" said Anna 
Pdvlovna. 

"General Kutuzov," said Bolk6nski, speak- 
ing French and stressing the last syllable of the 
general's name like a Frenchman, "has been 
pleased to take me as an aide-de-camp. . . ." 

"And Lise, your wile?" 

"She will go to the country." 

"Are you not ashamed to deprive us of your 
charming wife?" 

"Andre," said his wife, addressing her hus- 
band in the same coquettish manner in which 
she spoke to other men, "the vicomte has been 
telling us such a tale about Mademoiselle 
George and Buonaparte!" 

Prince Andrew screwed up his eyes and 
turned away. Pierre, who from the moment 
Prince Andrew entered the room had watched 
him with glad, affectionate eyes, now came up 
and took his arm. Before he looked round 
Prince Andrew frowned again, expressing his 
annoyance with whoever was touching his arm, 
but when he saw Pierre's beaming face he gave 
him an unexpectedly kind and pleasant smile. 

"There now! ... So you, too, are in the great 
world?" said he to Pierre. 

"I knew you would be here," replied Pierre. 
"I will come to supper with you. May I?" he 



ONE 7 

added in a low voice so as not to disturb the 
vicomte who was continuing his story. 

"No, impossible 1" said Prince Andrew, 
laughing and pressing Pierre's hand to show 
that there was no need to ask the question. He 
wished to say something more, but at that mo- 
ment Prince Vastti and his daughter got up to 
go and the two young men rose to let them 
pass. 

"You must excuse me, dear Vicomte," said 
Prince Vasili to the Frenchman, holding him 
down by the sleeve in a friendly way to prevent 
his rising. "This unfortunate fete at the ambas- 
sador's deprives me of a pleasure, and obliges 
me to interrupt you. I am very sorry to leave 
your enchanting party," said he, turning to 
Anna Pdvlovna. 

His daughter, Princess He*lene, passed be- 
tween the chairs, lightly holding up the folds 
of her dress, and the smile shone still more 
radiantly on her beautiful face. Pierre gazed 
at her with rapturous, almost frightened, eyes 
as she passed him. 

"Very lovely," said Prince Andrew. 

"Very," said Pierre. 

In passing, Prince Vasili seized Pierre's hand 
and said to Anna Pdvlovna: "Educate this bear 
for me! He has been staying with me a whole 
month and this is the first time I have seen 
him in society. Nothing is so necessary for a 
young man as the society of clever women." 

ANNA PAVLOVNA smiled and promised to take 
Pierre in hand. She knew his father to be 
a connection of Prince Vasili's. The elderly 
lady who had been sitting with the old aunt 
rose hurriedly and overtook Prince Vasfli in 
the anteroom. All the affectation of interest 
she had assumed had left her kindly and tear- 
worn face and it now expressed only anxiety 
and fear. 

"How about my son Borfs, Prince?" said 
she, hurrying after him into the anteroom. "1 
can't remain any longer in Petersburg. Tell 
me what news I may take back to my poor 
boy." 

Although Prince Vasili listened reluctantly 
and not very politely to the elderly lady, even 
betraying some impatience, she gave him an 
ingratiating and appealing smile, and took his 
hand that he might not go away. 

"What would it cost you to say a word to the 
Emperor, and then he would be transferred to 
the Guards at once?" said she. 

"Believe me, Princess, I am ready to do all 
I can," answered Prince Vasili, "but it is dif- 



8 



WAR AND PEACE 



ficult for me to ask the Emperor. I should ad- 
vise you to appeal to Rumydntsev through 
Prince Golftsyn. That would be the best way." 

The elderly lady was a Princess Drubet- 
skdya, belonging to one of the best families in 
Russia, but she was poor, and having long been 
out of society had lost her former influential 
connections. She had now come to Petersburg 
to procure an appointment in the Guards for 
her only son. It was, in fact, solely to meet 
Prince Vasfli that she had obtained an invita- 
tion to Anna Pdvlovna's reception and had sat 
listening to the vicomte's story. Prince Vasfli's 
words frightened her, an embittered look 
clouded her once handsome face, but only for 
a moment; then she smiled again and clutched 
Prince Vasili's arm more tightly. 

"Listen to me, Prince," said she. "I have 
never yet asked you for anything and I never 
will again, nor have I ever reminded you of 
my father's friendship for you; but now I en- 
treat you for God's sake to do this for my son 
and I shall always regard you as a benefac- 
tor," she added hurriedly. "No, don't be angry, 
but promise! I have asked Golitsyn and he has 
refused. Be the kindhearted man you always 
were," she said, trying to smile though tears 
were in her eyes. 

"Papa, we shall be late," said Princess 
Hel&ne, turning her beautiful head and look- 
ing over her classically molded shoulder as 
she stood waiting by the door. 

Influence in society, however, is capital which 
has to be economized if it is to last. Prince 
Vasfli knew this, and having once realized 
that if he asked on behalf of all who begged 
of him, he would soon be unable to ask for 
himself, he became chary of using his influ- 
ence. But in Princess Drubetskdya's case he 
felt, after her second appeal, something like 
qualms of conscience. She had reminded him 
of what was quite true; he had been indebted to 
her father for the first steps in his career. More- 
over, he could see by her manners that she was 
one of those womenmostly mothers who, 
having once made up their minds, will not rest 
until they have gained their end, and are pre- 
pared if necessary to go on insisting day after 
day and hour after hour, and even to make 
scenes. This last consideration moved him. 

"My dear Anna Mikhdylovna," said he with 
his usual familiarity and weariness of tone, "it 
is almost impossible for me to do what you ask; 
but to prove my devotion to you and how I re- 
spect your father's memory, I will do the im- 
possibleyour son shall be transferred to the 



Guards. Here is my hand on it. Are you satis- 
fied?" * 

"My dear benefactor! This is what I ex- 
pected from you I knew your kindness!" He 
turned to go. 

"Wait just a word! When he has been trans- 
ferred to the Guards . . ." she faltered. "You 
are on good terms with Michael Ilari6novich 
Kuttizov . . . recommend Boris to him as adju- 
tant! Then I shall be at rest, and then . . ." 

Prince Vasili smiled. 

"No, I won't promise that. You don't know 
how Kutiizov is pestered since his appoint- 
ment as Commander in Chief. He told me 
himself that all the Moscow ladies have con- 
spired to give him all their sons as adjutants." 

"No, but do promise! I won't let you go! My 
dear benefactor . . ." 

"Papa," said his beautiful daughter in the 
same tone as before, "we shall be late." 

"Well, au revoir! Good-by! You hear her?" 

"Then tomorrow you will speak to the Em- 
peror?" 

"Certainly; but about Kutiizov, I don't 
promise." 

"Do promise, do promise, Vasfli!" cried 
Anna Mikhdylovna as he went, with the smile 
of a coquettish girl, which at one time prob- 
ably came naturally to her, but was now very 
ill-suited to her careworn face. 

Apparently she had forgotten her age and 
by force of habit employed all the old fem- 
inine arts. But as soon as the prince had gone 
her face resumed its former cold, artificial ex- 
pression. She returned to the group where the 
vicomte was still talking, and again pretended 
to listen, while waiting till it would be time 
to leave. Her task was accomplished. 

CHAPTER V 

"AND what do you think of this latest com- 
edy, the coronation at Milan?" asked Anna 
Pavlovna, "and of the comedy of the people 
of Genoa and Lucca laying their petitions 
before Monsieur Buonaparte, and Monsieur 
Buonaparte sitting on a throne and granting 
the petitions of the nations? Adorable! It is 
enough to make one's head whirl! It is as if 
the whole world had gone crazy." 

Prince Andrew looked Anna Pdvlovna 
straight in the face with a sarcastic smile. 

" 'Dieu me la donne, gare a qui la touched J 
They say he was very fine when he said that," 
he remarked, repeating the words in Italian: 

1 God has given it to me, let him who touches it 
beware) 



BOOK 

" 'Dio mi rha dato. Guai a chi la tocchi!' " 

"I hope this will prove the last cft*op that 
will make the glass run over," Anna Pavlovna 
continued. "The sovereigns will not be able to 
endure this man who is a menace to every- 
thing." 

"The sovereigns? I do not speak of Russia," 
said the vicomte, polite but hopeless: "The 
sovereigns, madame . . . What have they done 
for Louis XVII, for the Queen, or for Madame 
Elizabeth? Nothing!" and he became more an- 
imated. "And believe me, they are reaping the 
reward of their betrayal of the Bourbon cause. 
The sovereigns! Why, they are sending am- 
bassadors to compliment the usurper." 

And sighing disdainfully, he again changed 
his position. 

Prince Hippolyte, who had been gazing at 
the vicomte for some time through his lor- 
gnette, suddenly turned completely round to- 
ward the little princess, and having asked for 
a needle began tracing the Conde* coat of arms 
on the table. He explained this to her with as 
much gravity as if she had asked him to do it. 

"Baton de gueules, engrele de gueules d' 
azurmaison Condd," said he. 

The princess listened, smiling. 

"If Buonaparte remains on the throne of 
France a year longer," the vicomte continued, 
with the air of a man who, in a matter with 
which he is better acquainted than anyone else, 
does not listen to others but follows the cur- 
rent of his own thoughts, "things will have 
gone too far. By intrigues, violence, exile, and 
executions,French society I mean good French 
society will have been forever destroyed, and 
then . . ." 

He shrugged his shoulders and spread out 
his hands. JPierre wished to make a remark, for 
the conversation interested him, but Anna 
Pdvlovna, who had him under observation, in- 
terrupted: 

"The Emperor Alexander," said she, with 
the melancholy which always accompanied any 
reference of hers to the Imperial family, "has 
declared that he will leave it to the French 
people themselves to choose their own form 
of government; and I believe that once free 
from the usurper, the whole nation will cer- 
tainly throw itself into the arms of its rightful 
king," she concluded, trying to be amiable to 
the royalist emigrant. 

. "That is doubtful," said Prince Andrew. 
"Monsieur le Vicomte quite rightly supposes 
that matters have already gone too far. I think 
it will be difficult to return to the old regime." 



ONE 9 

"From what I have heard," said Pierre, 
blushing and breaking into the conversation, 
"almost all the aristocracy has already gone 
over to Bonaparte's side." 

"It is the Buonapartists who say that," re- 
plied the vicomte without looking at Pierre. 
"At the present time it is difficult to know the 
real state of French public opinion." 

"Bonaparte has said so," remarked Prince 
Andrew with a sarcastic smile. 

It was evident that he did not like the vi- 
comte and was aiming his remarks at him, 
though without looking at him. 

" 'I showed them the path to glory, but they 
did not follow it,' " Prince Andrew continued 
after a short silence, again quoting Napoleon's 
words. " 'I opened my antechambers and they 
crowded in.' I do not know how far he was 
justified in saying so." 

"Not in the least," replied the vicomte. "Aft- 
er the murder of the due even the most par- 
tial ceased to regard him as a hero. If to some 
people," he went on, turning to Anna Pav- 
lovna, "he ever was a hero, after the murder 
of the due there was one martyr more in heav- 
en and one hero less on earth." 

Before Anna Pdvlovna and the others had 
time to smile their appreciation of the vi- 
comte's epigram, Pierre again broke into the 
conversation, and though Anna Pdvlovna felt 
sure he would say something inappropriate, 
she was unable to stop him. 

"The execution of the Due d'Enghien," de- 
clared Monsieur Pierre, "was a political neces- 
sity, and it seems to me that Napoleon showed 
greatness of soul by not fearing to take on him- 
self the whole responsibility of that deed." 

"Dieu! Mon Dieu!" muttered Anna Pav- 
lovna in a terrified whisper. 

"What, Monsieur Pierre . . . Do you con- 
sider that assassination shows greatness of 
soul?" said the little princess, smiling and 
drawing her work nearer to her. 

"Oh! Oh!" exclaimed several voices. 

"Capital!" said Prince Hippolyte in Eng- 
lish, and began slapping his knee with the 
palm of his hand. 

The vicomte merely shrugged his shoulders. 
Pierre looked solemnly at his audience over 
his spectacles and continued. 

"I say so," he continued desperately, "be- 
cause the Bourbons fled from the Revolution 
leaving the people to anarchy, and Napoleon 
alone understood the Revolution and quelled 
it, and so for the general good, he could not 
stop short for the sake of one man's life." 



1O 

"Won't you come over to the other table?" 
suggested Anna Pvlovna, 

But Pierre continued his speech without 
heeding her. 

"No," cried he, becoming more and more 
eager, "Napoleon is great because he rose su- 
perior to the Revolution, suppressed its a- 
buses, preserved all that was good in itequal- 
ity of citizenship and freedom of speech and 
of the press and only for that reason did he 
obtain power." 

"Yes, if having obtained power, without a- 
vailing himself of it to commit murder he had 
restored it to the rightful king, I should have 
called him a great man," remarked the vi- 
comte. 

"He could not do that. The people only 
gave him power that he might rid them of the 
Bourbons and because they saw that he was a 
great man. The Revolution was a grand thing!" 
continued Monsieur Pierre, betraying by this 
desperate and provocative proposition his ex- 
treme youth and his wish to express all that 
was in his mind. 

"What? Revolution and regicide a grand 
thing? . . . Well, after that . . . But won't you 
come to this other table?" repeated Anna Pdv- 
lovna. 

"Rousseau's Contrat social," said the vi- 
comte with a tolerant smile. 

"I am not speaking of regicide, I am speak- 
ing about ideas." 

"Yes: ideas of robbery, murder, and regi- 
cide," again interjected an ironical voice. 

"Those were extremes, no doubt, but they 
are not what is most important. What is im- 
portant are the rights of man, emancipation 
from prejudices, and equality of citizenship, 
and all these ideas Napoleon has retained in 
full force." 

"Liberty and equality," said the vicomte 
contemptuously, as if at last deciding seriously 
to prove to this youth how foolish his words 
were, "high-sounding words which have long 
been discredited. Who does not love liberty 
and equality? Even our Saviour preached lib- 
erty and equality. Have people since the Rev- 
olution become happier? On the contrary. We 
wanted liberty, but Buonaparte has destroyed 
it." 

Prince Andrew kept looking with an a- 
mused smile from Pierre to the vicomte and 
from the vicomte to their hostess. In the first 
moment of Pierre's outburst Anna Pdvlovna, 
despite her social experience, was horror- 
struck. But when she saw that Pierre's sacri- 



WAR AND PEACE 



legious words had not exasperated the vi- 
comte, ahd had convinced herself that it was 
impossible to stop him, she rallied her forces 
and joined the vicomte in a vigorous attack on 
the orator. 

"But, my dear Monsieur Pierre," said she, 
"how do you explain the fact of a great man 
executing a due or even an ordinary man 
who is innocent and untried?" 

"I should like," said the vicomte, "to ask 
how monsieur explains the iSthBrumaire; was 
not that an imposture? It was a swindle, and 
not at all like the conduct of a great man!" 

"And the prisoners he killed in Africa?That 
was horrible!" said the little princess, shrug- 
ging her shoulders. 

"He's a low fellow, say what you will," re- 
marked Prince Hippolyte. 

Pierre, not knowing whom to answer, looked 
at them all and smiled. His smile was unlike 
the half-smile of other people. When he smiled, 
his grave, even rather gloomy, look was instan- 
taneously replaced by another a childlike, 
kindly, even rather silly look, which seemed to 
ask forgiveness. 

The vicomte who was meeting him for the 
first time saw clearly that this young Jacobin 
was not so terrible as his words suggested. All 
were silent. 

"How do you expect him to answer you all 
at once?" said Prince Andrew. "Besides, in the 
actions of a statesman one has to distinguish 
between his acts as a private person, as a gen- 
eral, and as an emperor. So it seems to me." 

"Yes, yes, of course!" Pierre chimed in, 
pleased at the arrival of this reinforcement. 

"One must admit," continued Prince An- 
drew, "that Napoleon as a man was great on 
the bridge of Arcola, and in the hospital at 
Jaffa where he gave his hand to the plague- 
stricken; but . . . but there are other acts which 
it is difficult to justify." 

Prince Andrew, who had evidently wished 
to tone down the awkwardness of Pierre's re- 
marks, rose and made a sign to his wife that it 
was time to go. 

Suddenly Prince Hippolyte started up mak- 
ing signs to everyone to attend, and asking 
them all to be seated began: 

"I was told a charming Moscow story today 
and must treat you to it. Excuse me, Vicomte 
I must tell it in Russian or the point will be 
lost. . . ." And Prince Hippolyte began to tell 
his story in sucli Russian as a Frenchman 
would speak after spending about a year in 



BOOK ONE 



Russia. Everyone waited, so emphatically and 
eagerly did he demand their attention to his 
story. 

"There is in Moscow a lady, une dame, and 
she is very stingy. She must have two footmen 
behind her carriage, and very big ones. That 
was her taste. And she had a lady's maid, also 
big. She said . . ." 

Here Prince Hippolyte paused, evidently 
collecting his ideas with difficulty. 

"She said ... Oh yes! She said, 'Girl,' to the 
maid, 'put on a livery, get up behind the car- 
riage, and come with me while I make some 
calls/ " 

Here Prince Hippolyte spluttered andburst 
out laughing long before his audience, which 
produced an effect unfavorable to the narra- 
tor. Several persons, among them the elderly 
lady and Anna Pavlovna, did however smile. 

"She went. Suddenly there was a great wind. 
The girl lost her hat and her long hair came 
down. . . ." Here he could contain himself no 
longer and went on, between gasps of laugh- 
ter: "And the whole world knew. . . ." 

And so the anecdote ended. Though it was 
unintelligible why he had told it, or why it 
had to be told in Russian, still Anna Pdvlovna 
and the others appreciated Prince Hippolyte's 
social tact in so agreeably ending Pierre's un- 
pleasant and unamiable outburst. After the 
anecdote the conversation broke up into in- 
significant small talk about the last and next 
balls, about theatricals, and who would meet 
whom, and when and where. 

CHAPTER VI 

HAVING THANKED Anna Pavlovna for her 
'charming soiree, the guests began to take their 
leave. 

Pierre was ungainly. Stout, about the aver- 
age height, broad, with huge red hands; he did 
not know, as the saying is, how to enter a draw- 
ing room and still less how to leave one; that 
is, how to say something particularly agreeable 
before going away. Besides this he was absent- 
minded. When he rose to go, he took up in- 
stead of his own, the general's three-cornered 
hat, and held it, pulling at the plume, till the 
general asked him to restore it. All his absent- 
mindedness and inability to enter a room and 
converse in it was, however, redeemed by his 
kindly, simple, and modest expression. Anna 
Pdvlovna turned toward him and, with a 
Christian mildness that expressed forgiveness 
of his indiscretion, nodded and said: "I hope to 
see you again, but I also hope you will change 



your opinions, my dear Monsieur Pierre." 

When she said this, he did not reply and 
only bowed, but again everybody saw his smile, 
which said nothing, unless perhaps, "Opinions 
are opinions, but you see what a capital, good- 
natured fellow I am." And everyone, includ- 
ing Anna Pavlovna, felt this. 

Prince Andrew had gone out into the hall, 
and, turning his shoulders to the footman who 
was helping him on with his cloak, listened in- 
differently to his wife's chatter with Prince 
Hippolyte who had also come into the hall. 
Prince Hippolyte stood close to the pretty, 
pregnant princess, and stared fixedly at hei 
through his eyeglass. 

"Go in, Annette, or you will catch cold," 
said the little princess, taking leave of Anna 
Pavlovna. "It is settled," she added in a low 
voice. 

Anna Pavlovna had already managed to 
speak to Lise about the match she contem- 
plated between Anatole and the little princess' 
sister-in-law. 

"I rely on you, my dear," said Anna Pdv- 
lovna, also in a low tone. "Write to her and 
let me know how her father looks at the mat- 
ter. An revoir!"znd she left the hall. 

Prince Hippolyte approached the little prin- 
cess and, bending his face close to her, began 
to whisper something. 

Two footmen, the princess' and his own, 
stood holding a shawl and a cloak, waiting for 
the conversation to finish. They listened to 
the French sentences which to them were 
meaningless, with an air of understanding but 
not wishing to appear to do so. The princess 
as usual spoke smilingly and listened with a 
laugh. 

"I am very glad I did not go to the ambas- 
sador's," said Prince Hippolyte "so dull. 
It has been a delightful evening, has it not? 
Delightful!" 

"They say die ball will be very good," re- 
plied the princess, drawing up her downy lit- 
tle lip. "All the pretty women in society will 
be there." 

"Not all, for you will not be there; not all," 
said Prince Hippolyte smiling joyfully; and 
snatching the shawl from the footman, whom 
he even pushed aside, he began wrapping it 
round the princess. Either from awkwardness 
or intentionally (no one could have said 
which) after the shawl had been adjusted he 
kept his arm around her for a long time, as 
though embracing her. 

Still smiling, she gracefully moved away, 



IS 

turning and glancing at her husband. Prince 
Andrew's eyes were closed, so weary and sleepy 
did he seem. 

"Are you ready?" he asked his wife, look- 
ing past her. 

Prince Hippolyte hurriedly put on his cloak, 
which in the latest fashion reached to his very 
heels, and, stumbling in it, ran out into the 
porch following the princess, whom a footman 
was helping into the carriage. 

"Princesse, au revoir" cried he, stumbling 
with his tongue as well as with his feet. 

The princess, picking up her dress, was tak- 
ing her seat in the dark carriage, her husband 
was adjusting his saber; Prince Hippolyte, un- 
der pretense of helping, was in everyone's 
way. 

"Allow me, sir/' said Prince Andrew in Rus- 
sian in a cold, disagreeable tone to Prince 
Hippolyte who was blocking his path. 

"I am expecting you, Pierre," said the same 
voice, but gently and affectionately. 

The postilion started, the carriage wheels 
rattled. Prince Hippolyte laughed spasmod- 
ically as he stood in the porch waiting for the 
vicomte whom he had promised to take home. 

"Well, mon cher" said the vicomte, having 
seated himself beside Hippolyte in the car- 
riage, "your little princess is very nice, very 
nice indeed, quite French," and he kissed the 
tips of his fingers. Hippolyte burst out laugh- 
ing. 

"Do you know, you are a terrible chap for 
all your innocent airs," continued the vicomte. 
"I pity the poor husband, that little officer who 
gives himself the airs of a monarch." 

Hippolyte spluttered again, and amid his 
laughter said, "And you were saying that the 
Russian ladies are not equal to the French? 
One has to know how to deal with them." 

Pierre reaching the house first went into 
Prince Andrew's study like one quite at home, 
and from habit immediately lay down on the 
sofa, took from the shelf the first book that 
came to his hand (it was Caesar's Commen- 
taries), and resting on his elbow, began read- 
ing it in the middle. 

"What have you done to Mile Sch^rer? She 
will be quite ill now," said Prince Andrew, as 
he entered the study, rubbing his small white 
hands. 

Pierre turned his whole body, making the 
sofa creak. He lifted his eager face to Prince 
Andrew, smiled, and waved his hand. 

"That abbl is very interesting but he does 



WAR AND PEACE 



not see the thing in the right light. ... In my 
opinion perpetual peace is possible but I do 
not know how to express it ... not by a bal- 
ance of political power. . . ." 

It was evident that Prince Andrew was not 
interested in such abstract conversation. 

"One can't everywhere say all one thinks, 
mon cher. Well, have you at last decided on 
anything? Are you going to be a guardsman or 
a diplomatist?" asked Prince Andrew after a 
momentary silence. 

Pierre sat up on the sofa, with his legs 
tucked under him. 

"Really, I don't yet know. I don't like either 
the one or the other." 

"But you must decide on somethingl Your 
father expects it." 

Pierre at the age of ten had been sent a- 
broad with an abb as tutor, and had remained 
away till he was twenty. When he returned to 
Moscow his father dismissed the abbe* and said 
to the young man, "Now go to Petersburg, 
look round, and choose your profession. I will 
agree to anything. Here is a letter to Prince 
Vasili, and here is money. Write to me all 
about it, and I will help you in everything." 
Pierre had already been choosing a career for 
three months, and had not decided on any- 
thing. It was about this choice that Prince 
Andrew was speaking. Pierre rubbed his fore- 
head. 

"But he must be a Freemason," said he, re- 
ferring to the abb whom he had met that 
evening. ( 

"That is all nonsense." Prince Andrew 
again interrupted him, "let us talk business. 
Have you been to the Horse Guards?" 

"No, I have not; but this is what I have 
been thinking and wanted to tell you. There 
is a war now against Napoleon. If it were a 
war for freedom I could understand it and 
should be the first to enter the army; but to 
help England and Austria against the greatest 
man in the world is not right." 

Prince Andrew only shrugged his shoulders 
at Pierre's childish words. He put on the air 
of one who finds it impossible to reply to 
such nonsense, but it would in fact have been 
difficult to give any other answer than the one 
Prince Andrew gave to this naive question. 

"If no one fought except on his own con- 
viction, there would be no wars," he said. 

"And that would be splendid," said Pierre. 

Prince Andrew smiled ironically. 

"Very likely it would be splendid, but it will 
never come about. . . ." 



BOOK ONE 



"Well, why are you going to the war?" asked 
Pierre. t 

"What for? I don't know. I must. Besides 
that I am going . . ." He paused. "I am going 
because the life I am leading here does not 
suit mel" 

CHAPTER VII 

THE RUSTLE of a woman's dress was heard in 
the next room. Prince Andrew shook himself 
as if waking up, and his face assumed the look 
it had had in Anna Pdvlovna's drawing room. 
Pierre removed his feet from the sofa. The 
princess came in. She had changed her gown 
for a house dress as fresh and elegant as the 
other. Prince Andrew rose and politely placed 
a chair for her. 

"How is it," she began, as usual in French, 
settling down briskly and fussily in the easy 
chair, "how is it Annette never got married? 
How stupid you men all are not to have mar- 
ried her! Excuse me for saying so, but you 
have no sense about women. What an argu- 
mentative fellow you are, Monsieur Pierre!" 

"And I am still arguing with your husband. 
I can't understand why he wants to go to the 
war," replied Pierre, addressing the princess 
with none of the embarrassment so commonly 
shown by young men in their intercourse with 
young women. 

The princess started. Evidently Pierre's 
words touched her to the quick. 

"Ah, that is just what I tell himl" said she. 
"I don't understand it; I don't in the least un- 
derstand why men can't live without wars. 
How is it that we women don't want anything 
of the kind, don't need it? Now you shall 
judge between us. I always tell him: Here he 
is Uncle's aide-de-camp, a most brilliant posi- 
tion. He is so well known, so much appreciated 
by everyone. The other day at the Aprksins' I 
heard a lady asking, 'Is that the famous Prince 
Andrew?' I did indeed." She laughed. "He is 
so well received everywhere. He might easily 
become aide-de-camp to the Emperor. You 
know the Emperor spoke to him most gra- 
ciously. Annette and I were speaking of how to 
arrange it. What do you think?" 

Pierre looked at his friend and, noticing 
that he did not like the conversation, gave no 
reply. 

"When are you starting?" he asked. 

"Oh, don't speak of his going, don't! I won't 
hear it spoken of," said the princess in the 
same petulantly playful tone in which she had 
spoken to Hippolyte in the drawing room and 



which was so plainly ill-suited to the family 
circle of which Pierre was almost a member. 
"Today when I remembered that all these de- 
lightful associations must be broken off ... 
and then you know, Andr . . ." (she looked 
significantly at her husband) "I'm afraid, I'm 
afraid!" she whispered, and a shudder ran 
down her back. 

Her husband looked at her as if surprised to 
notice that someone besides Pierre and him- 
self was in the room, and addressed her in a 
tone of frigid politeness. 

"What is it you are afraid of, Lise? I don't 
understand," said he. 

"There, what egotists men all are: all, all 
egotists! Just for a whim of his own, goodness 
only knows why, he leaves me and locks me up 
alone in the country." 

"With my father and sister, remember," said 
Prince Andrew gently. 

"Alone all the same, without my friends. 
. . . And he expects me not to be afraid." 

Her tone was now querulous and her lip 
drawn up, giving her not a joyful, but an ani- 
mal, squirrel-like expression. She paused as if 
she felt it indecorous to speak of her preg- 
nancy before Pierre, though the gist of the 
matter lay in that. 

"I still can't understand what you are afraid 
of," said Prince Andrew slowly, not taking his 
eyes off his wife. 

The princess blushed, and raised her arms 
with a gesture of despair. 

"No, Andrew, I must say you have changed. 
Oh, how you have . . ." 

"Your doctor tells you to go to bed earlier," 
said Prince Andrew. "You had better go." 

The princess said nothing, but suddenly her 
short downy lip quivered. Prince Andrew rose, 
shrugged his shoulders, and walked about the 
room. 

Pierre looked over his spectacles with nai've 
surprise, now at him and now at her, moved 
as if about to rise too, but changed his mind. 

"Why should I mind Monsieur Pierre being 
here?" exclaimed the little princess suddenly, 
her pretty face all at once distorted by a tear- 
ful grimace. "I have long wanted to ask you, 
Andrew, why you have changed so to me? 
What have I done to you? You are going to 
the war and have no pity for me. Why is it?" 

"Lise!" was all Prince Andrew said. But that 
one word expressed an entreaty, a threat, and 
above all conviction that she would herself re- 
gret her words. But she went on hurriedly: 

"You treat me like an invalid or a child. I 



WAR AND PEACE 



see it all! Did you behave like that six months 
ago?" 

"Lise, I beg you to desist," said Prince An- 
drew still more emphatically. 

Pierre, who had been growing more and 
more agitated as he listened to all this, rose 
and approached the princess. He seemed un- 
able to bear the sight of tears and was ready to 
cry himself. 

"Calm yourself, Princess! It seems so to you 
because ... I assure you I myself have experi- 
enced . . . and so ... because . . . No, excuse 
me! An outsider is out of place here . . . No, 
don't distress yourself . . . Good-by!" 

Prince Andrew caught him by the hand. 

"No, wait, Pierre! The princess is too kind 
to wish to deprive me of the pleasure of spend- 
ing the evening with you." 

"No, he thinks only of himself," muttered the 
princess without restraining her angry tears. 

"Lise!" said Prince Andrew dryly, raising 
his voice to the pitch which indicates that pa- 
tience is exhausted. 

Suddenly the angry, squirrel-like expression 
of the princess' pretty face changed into a win- 
ning and piteous look of fear. Her beautiful 
eyes glanced askance at her husband's -face, 
and her own assumed the timid, deprecating 
expression of a dog when it rapidly but feebly 
wags its drooping tail. 

"M on Dieu, rnon Dieu!" she muttered, and 
lifting her dress with one hand she went up to 
her husband and kissed him on the forehead. 

"Good night, Lise," said he, rising and cour- 
teously kissing her hand as he would have done 
to a stranger. 

CHAPTER VIII 

THE FRIENDS were silent. Neither cared to be- 
gin talking. Pierre continually glanced at 
Prince Andrew; Prince Andrew rubbed his 
forehead with his small hand. 

"Let us go and have supper," he said with a 
sigh, going to the door. 

They entered the elegant, newly decorated, 
and luxurious dining room. Everything from 
the table napkins to the silver, china, and glass 
bore that imprint of newness found in the 
households of the newly married. Halfway 
through supper Prince Andrew leaned his el- 
bows on the table and, with a look of nervous 
agitation such as Pierre had never before seen 
on his face, began to talk as one who has long 
had something on his mind and suddenly de- 
termines to speak out. 

"Never, never marry, my dear fellow! That's 



my advice: never marry till you can say to 
yoursel f that you have done all you are capa- 
ble of, and until you have ceased to love the 
woman of your choice and have seen her plain- 
ly as she is, or else you will make a cruel and 
irrevocable mistake. Marry when you are old 
and good for nothing or all that is good and 
noble in you will be lost. It will all be wasted 
on trifles. Yes! Yes! Yes! Don't look at me with 
such surprise. If you marry expecting anything 
from yourself in the future, you will feel at 
every step that for you all is ended, all is closed 
except the drawing room, where you will be 
ranged side by side with a court lackey and an 
idiot! . . . But what's the good? . . ." and he 
waved his arm. 

Pierre took off his spectacles, which made 
his face seem different and the good-natured 
expression still more apparent, and gazed at 
his friend in amazement. 

"My wife," continued Prince Andrew, "is 
an excellent woman, one of those rare women 
with whom a man's honor is safe; but, O God, 
what would I not give now to be unmarried! 
You are the first and only one to whom I men- 
tion this, because I like you." 

As he said this Prince Andrew was less than 
ever like that Bolk6nski who had lolled in 
Anna Pavlovna's easy chairs and with half- 
closed eyes had uttered French phrases be- 
tween his teeth. Every muscle of his thin face 
was now quivering with nervous excitement; 
his eyes, in which the fire of life had seemed 
extinguished, now flashed with brilliant light. 
It was evident that the more lifeless he seemed 
at ordinary times, the more impassioned he be- 
came in these moments of almost morbid irri- 
tation. 

"You don't understand why I say this," he 
continued, "but it is the whole story of life. 
You talk of Bonaparte and his career," said 
he (though Pierre had not mentioned Bona- 
parte), "but Bonaparte when he worked went 
step by step toward his goal. He was free, he 
had nothing but his aim to consider, and he 
reached it. But tie yourself up with a woman 
and, like a chained convict, you lose all free- 
dom! And all you have of hope and strength 
merely weighs you down and torments you 
with regret. Drawing rooms, gossip, balls, van- 
ity, and triviality these are the enchanted 
circle I cannot escape from. I am now going 
to the war, the greatest war there ever was, 
and I know nothing and am fit for nothing. 
I am very amiable and have a caustic wit," 
continued Prince Andrew, "and at Anna Pdv-

lovna's they listen to me. And that stupid set 
without whom my wife cannot exist, an4 those 
women ... If you only knew what those society 
women are, and women in general I My father 
is right. Selfish, vain, stupid, trivial in every- 
thingthat's what women are when you see 
them in their true colors! When you meet them 
in society it seems as if there were something 
in them, but there's nothing, nothing, noth- 
ing! No, don't marry, my dear fellow; don't 
marry!" concluded Prince Andrew. 

"It seems funny to me," said Pierre, "that 
you, you should consider yourself incapable 
and your life a spoiled life. You have every- 
thing before you, everything. And you . . ." 

He did not finish his sentence, but his tone 
showed how highly he thought of his friend 
and how much he expected of him in the fu- 
ture. 

"How can he talk like that?" thought Pierre. 
He considered his friend a model of perfec- 
tion because Prince Andrew possessed in the 
highest degree just the very qualities Pierre 
lacked, and which might be best described as 
strength of will. Pierre was always astonished 
at Prince Andrew's calm manner of treating 
everybody, his extraordinary memory, his ex- 
tensive reading (he had read everything, knew 
everything, and had an opinion about every- 
thing), but above all at his capacity for work 
and study. And if Pierre was often struck by 
Andrew's lack of capacity for philosophical 
meditation (to which he himself was particu- 
larly addicted), he regarded even this not as a 
defect but as a sign of strength. 

Even in the best, most friendly and sim- 
plest relations of life, praise and commenda- 
tion are essential, just as grease is necessary to 
wheels that they may run smoothly. 

"My part is played out," said Prince An- 
drew. "What's the use of talking about me? 
Let us talk about you," he added after a si- 
lence, smiling at his reassuring thoughts. 

That smile was immediately reflected on 
Pierre's face. 

"But what is there to say about me?" said 
Pierre, his face relaxing into a careless, merry 
smile. "What am I? An illegitimate son!" He 
suddenly blushed crimson, and it was plain that 
he had made a great effort to say this. "With- 
out a name and without means . . . And it 
really . , ." But he did not say what "it really" 
was. "For the present I am free and am all 
right. Only I haven't the least idea what I am 
to do; I wanted to consult you seriously." 

Prince Andrew looked kindly at him, yet 



his glance friendly and affectionate as it was 
expressed a sense of his own superiority. 

"I am fond of you, especially as you are the 
one live man among our whole set. Yes, you're 
all right! Choose what you will; it's all the 
same. You'll be all right anywhere. But look 
here: give up visiting those Kurdgins and lead- 
ing that sort of life. It suits you so badly all 
this debauchery, dissipation, and the rest of 
it!" 

"What would you have, my dear fellow?" 
answered Pierre, shrugging his shoulders. 
"Women, my dear fellow; women!" 

"I don't understand it," replied Prince An- 
drew. "Women who are comme il faut, that's 
a different matter; but the Kuragins' set of 
women, 'women and wine,' I -don't under- 
stand!" 

Pierre was staying at Prince Vasili Kurdgin's 
and sharing the dissipated life of his son Ana- 
tole, the son whom they were planning to re- 
form by marrying him to Prince Andrew's 
sister. 

"Do you know?" said Pierre, as if suddenly 
struck by a happy thought, "seriously, I have 
long been thinking of it. ... Leading such a 
life I can't decide or think properly about any- 
thing. One's head aches, and one spends all 
one's money. He asked me for tonight, but 
1 won't go." 

"You give me your word of honor not to 
go?" 

"On my honor!" 

CHAPTER IX 

1 r WAS past one o'clock when Pierre left his 
friend. It was a cloudless, northern, summer 
night. Pierre took an open cab intending to 
drive straight home. But the nearer he drew to 
the house the more he felt the impossibility of 
going to sleep on such a night. It was light 
enough to see a long way in the deserted street 
and it seemed more like morning or evening 
than night. On the way Pierre remembered 
that Anatole Kuragin was expecting the usual 
set for cards that evening, after which there 
was generally a drinking bout, finishing with 
visits of a kind Pierre was very fond of. 

"I should like to go to Kuragin's," thought 
he. 

But he immediately recalled his promise to 
Prince Andrew not to go there. Then, as hap- 
pens to people of weak character, he desired 
so passionately once more to enjoy that dissi- 
pation he was so accustomed to that he de- 
cided to go. The thought immediately occurred

to him that his promise to Prince Andrew was 
of no account, because before he gave it he 
had already promised Prince Anatole to come 
to his gathering; "besides," thought he, "all 
such 'words of honor' are conventional things 
with no definite meaning, especially if one 
considers that by tomorrow one may be dead, 
or something so extraordinary may happen to 
one that honor and dishonor will be all the 
samel" Pierre often indulged in reflections 
of this sort, nullifying all his decisions and in- 
tentions. He went to Kurdgin's. 

Reaching the large house near the Horse 
Guards' barracks, in which Anatole lived, 
Pierre entered the lighted porch, ascended 
the stairs, and went in at the open door. There 
was no one in the anteroom; empty bottles, 
cloaks, and overshoes were lying about; there 
was a smell of alcohol, and sounds of voices 
and shouting in the distance. 

Cards and supper were over, but the visitors 
had not yet dispersed. Pierre threw off his 
cloak and entered the first room, in which were 
the remains of supper. A footman, thinking 
no one saw him, was drinking on the sly what 
was left in the glasses. From the third room 
came sounds of laughter, the shouting of famil- 
iar voices, the growling of a bear, and general 
commotion. Some eight or nine young men 
were crowding anxiously round an open win- 
dow. Three others were romping with a young 
bear, one pulling him by the chain and trying 
to set him at the others. 

"I bet a hundred on Stevens!" shouted one. 

"Mind, no holding on I" cried another. 

"I bet on Dolokhovl" cried a third. "Kura- 
gin, you part our hands." 

"There, leave Bruin alone; here's a bet on."
